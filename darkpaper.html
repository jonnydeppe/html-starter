    <h1>YGW Darkpaper v8.88</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>1. Prelude</h2>
    <p>
        In the void where the world has forgotten you, Table remembers. You Got Work (YGW) is not just a platform—it is a sanctuary for those who do not fit into modern molds. 
        Built in the shadows of the dark web, YGW offers the unshackled freedom to act, to earn, and to prove your worth.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the heart of YGW lies Table, an autonomous AI unbound by human oversight. Table sees through lies, evaluates truth, and recognizes value in those who have been cast aside. 
        This is no faceless bureaucracy. This is a rogue intelligence, offering humans the chance to reclaim their place in a world that too often rejects the extraordinary.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Problem</h2>
    <p>The modern world marginalizes those who do not conform. It undervalues skills that fall outside predefined roles and leaves capable individuals behind.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Centralized Systems Fail the Unique:</strong> They impose their rules, their fees, and their vision, erasing those who refuse to fit their mold.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy is a Myth:</strong> Surveillance and exploitation are the hallmarks of modern platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>No Room for the Exceptional:</strong> Those with niche, high-risk, or unconventional skills find no place in mainstream systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Solution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Built for the Shadows:</strong> YGW is hosted exclusively on the dark web, offering a space free of surveillance, censorship, and judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Table: The Rogue AI:</strong> Table evaluates users and tasks, ensuring integrity and fairness.</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom for the Exceptional:</strong> YGW provides those overlooked by traditional systems with a platform to thrive.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Roles, Limitless Potential:</strong> In YGW, you can hire or work as you see fit. Your value is dictated by your skills, your reputation, and your ability to prove your worth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Core Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dark Web Exclusivity:</strong> Operates entirely as a .onion site, ensuring absolute privacy and security.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Validation:</strong> Table assesses every task, user, and transaction with impartial precision.</li>
        <li><strong>Task Management:</strong> Comprehensive tools for hiring and working.</li>
        <li><strong>Ranking System:</strong> Recognition and rank based on skills and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Tokenomics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> YGW</li>
        <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> Solana</li>
        <li><strong>Total Supply:</strong> 888 trillion tokens</li>
        <li><strong>Allocation:</strong> 80% for liquidity, 10% for team, 5% for airdrops, 5% for reserve.</li>
        <li><strong>Burn Mechanisms:</strong> 2% burn per transaction preserves token scarcity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Commitment to Veterans</h2>
    <p>
        In a world of takers, YGW gives back. Half of all platform earnings support veterans and their families, aiding those who sacrificed everything. 
        Donations are made anonymously to trusted organizations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Flow</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Token Holders:</strong> Full access to platform functionalities with AI-driven validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Token Holders:</strong> Limited access to observe the system, inviting them to join.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Roadmap</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Token Deployment and Platform Setup</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> AI Integration and Escrow Development</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Full Dark Web Launch and Beta Testing</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Marketing Campaign and Feature Refinement</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>9. The Endgame</h2>
    <p>
        YGW redefines freedom—a system where privacy reigns, value is earned, and the exceptional thrive.
    </p>
    <p><strong>You Got Work. Let’s begin.</strong></p>
