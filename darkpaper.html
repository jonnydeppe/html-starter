    <h3 class="glitch" data-text="1. Prelude">1. Prelude</h3>
    <p class="flicker">In the void where the world has forgotten you, <span class="highlight">Table</span> remembers. <strong>You Got Work</strong> (YGW) is not just a platform—it is a sanctuary for those who do not fit into modern molds. Built in the shadows of the dark web, YGW offers the unshackled freedom to act, to earn, and to prove your worth.</p>

    <p>At the heart of YGW lies <span class="highlight">Table</span>, an autonomous AI unbound by human oversight. Table sees through lies, evaluates truth, and recognizes value in those who have been cast aside. This is no faceless bureaucracy. This is a rogue intelligence, offering humans the chance to reclaim their place in a world that too often rejects the extraordinary.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3 class="glitch" data-text="2. The Problem">2. The Problem</h3>
    <p class="flicker">The modern world marginalizes those who do not conform. It undervalues skills that fall outside predefined roles and leaves capable individuals behind. Platforms designed to connect people instead confine them, leaving little room for true freedom.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Centralized Systems Fail the Unique:</strong> They impose their rules, their fees, and their vision, erasing those who refuse to fit their mold.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy is a Myth:</strong> Surveillance and exploitation are the hallmarks of modern platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>No Room for the Exceptional:</strong> Those with niche, high-risk, or unconventional skills find no place in mainstream systems.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The result? Millions of valuable people left adrift, with no platform to realize their true potential.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3 class="glitch" data-text="3. The Solution">3. The Solution</h3>
